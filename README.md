## 💻 Requirements

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Install XAMPP

Download and install from:
🔗 [https://www.apachefriends.org/](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
Make sure to install Apache and MySQL components.

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install from:
🔗 [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 3. Set Up Project Directory

* Go to: `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
* Create a folder named: `recipe-web-app`
* Copy all project files into this folder

### 4. 🔐 Set or Update MySQL Root Password

By default, XAMPP sets the MySQL root password to blank (`''`). If you set a custom password, you'll need to update it both in your **code** and in **XAMPP/phpMyAdmin**.

#### ✅ Update in the Code

Edit the files in the following paths: 
* recipe-web-app/includes/db.php
* recipe-web-app/includes/init.php

Find this line:
```php
$password = '';
```
Change it to your custom password:
```php
$password = 'your_custom_password';
```

✅ Set Password in XAMPP (phpMyAdmin)
1. Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
2. Go to the User Accounts tab
3. Locate the row for root@localhost
4. Click Edit Privileges
5. Scroll to the Change Password section
6. Enter your new password and confirm it
7. Click Go

⚠️ If the password in your PHP code does not match the one set in phpMyAdmin, the app won’t be able to connect to the database.

### 5. Start Apache and MySQL

* Launch the **XAMPP Control Panel**
* Start the following services:

  * ✅ Apache
  * ✅ MySQL

### 6. Launch the App

* Visit: `http://localhost/recipe-web-app/`
* On first run, the app will:

  * ✅ Automatically create the `recipe_app` database if it doesn't exist
  * ✅ Import schema and data from `/sql/recipe_app_dump.sql` file

**Note:** You can continue adding more seed data in the `recipe_app_dump.sql` file. It will be automatically reloaded if new data is not already present.

### 7. (Optional) Verify Setup

Open the test script:
🔗 `http://localhost/recipe-web-app/test/test_db.php`
This will confirm connection and list tables.
